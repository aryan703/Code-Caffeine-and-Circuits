# ☕⚡ Code, Caffeine & Circuits

**AI & Robotics — software-driven intelligence for real-world systems.**

This repository marks the beginning of a journey focused on **two tightly connected domains**:

- **Artificial Intelligence** — perception, learning, decision-making, and reasoning  
- **Robotics** — autonomy, navigation, control logic, and system integration  

The emphasis is on the **software side of robotics**, where AI models and algorithms are designed, integrated, and deployed to enable intelligent robotic behavior.

This space captures experiments, ideas, and implementations that sit at the intersection of **AI algorithms and robotic systems**, documenting both progress and learning along the way.

Built with curiosity, long debugging sessions, and plenty of caffeine.

The journey starts here.

# ☕⚡ Code, Caffeine & Circuits

**AI-driven robotics — focused on software, autonomy, and intelligent systems.**

This repository marks the beginning of a journey into **AI-powered robotics**, with a strong emphasis on the **software side of building intelligent machines**.

The work here explores how perception, decision-making, and autonomy come together in robotic systems — from standalone algorithms to fully integrated robot software stacks.

Built with curiosity, long debugging sessions, and plenty of caffeine.

The journey starts here.
